# 95LNX
A homebrew mainboard replacement for the 95 LX that runs linux.

Goals:
 - Reverse engineer 95 LX LCD (Maybe the 100LX too)
 - Find a way to control the LCD (Preliminary testing shows that 1mhz clock is likely needed)
 - Design a custom PCB using KiCad with the pads necessary to interface with the integrated keyboard.
 - ???
 - Profit (And maybe write a text RPG)
